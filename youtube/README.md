# youtube
Posts in a channel every time a new video is added to a YouTube channel.

Biggest advantages over `Tube`:

-   Fetch any YouTube feed only once per interval, independent of how many Discord channels are subscribed to it
-   Add YouTube channels or edit their options with almost any URL. No more manual fiddling around to get the Channel ID
-   Better reports on what YouTube channels are monitored and where they are posted

Please be aware that the "new" https://www.youtube.com/@channelName URLs are not yet supported by the upstream library `PyTube` used in this project. Please use any video URL from such channels until the upstream issue has been resolved.

## Usage
This cog can be called as `[p]youtube` or with its alias `[p]yt`.
